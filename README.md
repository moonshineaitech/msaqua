# Moonshine AQUA Python Package | Autonomous Quasi-Unlimited Agent AI Training

Moonshine AI's msaqua: Autonomous Quasi-Unlimited Agent AI (Python Package)
msaqua is a Python package designed to automate workflows using cutting-edge Functional Specific Learning Algorithms (FSLAs) from the world of reinforcement learning. It empowers developers to create intelligent agents capable of adapting to complex environments and tasks.

Key Features:

Modular Design: Built for flexibility, allowing you to integrate various FSLAs through separate agent classes.
FSLA Support: Currently supports Rainbow, CURL, and PPO algorithms (more can be added).
Customizable: Hyperparameters and agent implementations can be tailored to specific needs.
Easy to Use: Provides a clear structure and well-documented code for efficient development.
Getting Started:

Installation:

Bash
pip install msaqua
Use code with caution.
Basic Usage:  (Assuming you have a custom environment defined)

Python
import gym  # Assuming you're using Gym for environments

from msaqua.agents import RainbowAgent  # Choose your desired FSLA agent

# Create your environment
env = gym.make('YourCustomEnv-v0')

# Initialize the agent with appropriate state and action dimensions
agent = RainbowAgent(env.observation_space.shape[0], env.action_space.n)

# Training loop (replace with your specific training logic)
for episode in range(100):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        # Update the agent based on experience (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        agent.learn(...)  # Replace with your learning logic
        state = next_state

env.close()
Use code with caution.
Documentation: 

Refer to the code within the agents/ directory for detailed implementations of different FSLA agents.
The utils/replay_buffer.py file provides a basic implementation of a replay buffer for experience storage.
